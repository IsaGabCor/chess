# Chess Engine (In Progress)

This repository contains my personal chess engine project — the same one featured on my Google Sites portfolio:
https://sites.google.com/view/isaiahsdsuportfolio/projects/chess-engine

It’s an early-stage project focused on exploring search algorithms, board evaluation, and legal move generation.

---

## Project Overview

This chess engine grew out of my interest in both chess and software engineering. The goal is to build a fully functional engine from scratch, with:

- Board representation
- Move generation
- Evaluation and search techniques
- Eventually a user interface and playable experience

You can read a summary of the project on my portfolio page as well.

---

## Current Status

The engine is in its early stages of development and emphasizes correct rules and logic implementation over strength or polish at this point.

### Implemented / In Progress

- Board representation using FEN notation
- Pygame board visualization
- Basic game state tracking (in progress)
- Legal move generation (in progress)

---

## Planned Features

These are the enhancements I plan to build next:

- Perft testing for move validation
- Board evaluation function
- Minimax search with alpha-beta pruning

---

## Technical Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pygame (for board visualization)
- **Core Concepts:** Data structures, recursion, tree search

If you decide to change languages later, you can update this section accordingly.

## What I’m Learning

This project is helping me grow in:

- Algorithmic complexity and optimization
- Recursive search and tree structures
- Python and Pygame development
- Writing expandable and maintainable code

---

## How to Run (Early Stage)

At the moment, this project is under active development and *does not yet have a stable user execution path*.

Once the engine supports playability or automated testing, I’ll update this section with clear instructions.

## Notes

This repo and project will evolve over time. Feel free to browse the commit history to see how it changes!
